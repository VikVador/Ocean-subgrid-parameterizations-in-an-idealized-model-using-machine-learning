\sectionemptyTFE{Abstract}

This research aims to explore novel methods for parameterizing the contributions of subgrid-scale processes, which refer to physical phenomena occurring at scales finer than the simulation resolution. More precisely, this work is built upon the research of \cite{Benchmarking}, who, after many years of parameterization development, have created a framework to properly conduct the assessment of the quality of a parameterization.\\

In addition to replicating their findings, this study extends its scope by attempting to enhance their results through a series of experiments involving more complex datasets. Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, it delves into the use of Fourier Neural Operators for modeling subgrid-scale process contributions. These neural networks were recently introduced by \cite{FNO}, and have already exhibited impressive results in many areas of computational fluid dynamics. Hence, while building upon the foundation laid by \cite{Benchmarking}, this study also pioneers the use of Fourier Neural Operators in this context, subjecting them to comprehensive evaluation within the established benchmarking framework.\\

In conclusion, this research not only facilitates a comprehensive grasp of the underlying physics in ocean-climate simulations but also delves into unexplored realms by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for modeling subgrid-scale processes contributions. The conclusive results show promise and underscore the notion that the most captivating discoveries frequently emerge at the crossroads of two captivating scientific domains.

I, Victor Mangeleer, born on August 16, 2000, hereby confirm that I am the author of the master's thesis titled "\textit{Ocean Subgrid Parameterization in an Idealized Model Using Machine Learning}."\\

All sources used in my research have been duly acknowledged and referenced. Any figures included in this work have either been handcrafted by me, generated using my original code, or borrowed from a paper with proper citation.\\

Chapter 2, which provides an introduction to fluid mechanics, has been guided by Prof. Vincent Terrapon's course \textit{Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics}. While I have independently written the content, I acknowledge that the chapter draws significant inspiration from the course.\\

Furthermore, I acknowledge that I have refined some portions of my original text in collaboration with the ChatGPT language model to enhance its clarity and coherence.

Every journey has to come to an end eventually. I am truly thankful to the University of Li√®ge for helping me become who I am today.\\

I would also like to extend my appreciation to my advisor, Prof. Gilles Louppe. I do not think he realizes how much believing in someone can actually change their life for the better. Thanks a lot, and I am really looking forward to more collaborations in the future.\\

I also want to thank all the professors in the Master of Physics Engineering program at the University. Since we were only a small group of students, we got to know each other well. I have met some amazing people who are all really interesting. Your dedication throughout these last two years of the master's program has made me even more excited about doing research. Your passion for what you do has motivated me more than ever.\\

Lastly, my deepest thank you goes to my friends, family, and girlfriend. It is not possible to put together words strong enough to explain how grateful I am for having you in my life.\\

\vspace{0.3cm}

I love you all.
